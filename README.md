# StoreApiNest Project

## Overview

This is a **NestJS backend API** for a store application. The API is built to support a React frontend application that I have on my github account by providing **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for managing products, categories, and keywords. The core functions of the API include getting a list of products, retrieving a product by its ID, adding new products, updating product categories and keywords, and deleting products.

The API is designed to be used in conjunction with a frontend React application where all the requests are made to this backend service.


### Features

- **User Authorization**: User registration and login
- **Product Management**: Create, read, update, and delete products, and updating search filters like keywords and categories.
